# Assignment 2: Project Idea
## Keller Mason

### Brief Summary: 

I want to build a website/ app that is able to give the user information on
local charities and non-profit organizations. The goal is to make it easy and
convenient to find out where one can contribute to their community. At the
click of a button, I want them to have contact information, donation links,
a short description, a list of upcoming volunteer opportunities, and several
other convenient links.

### Problem:

Many people are not aware of the ways that they can contribute to their local
community. In order to provide them with that awareness, I want to create a
convenient piece of software that allows them to find said ways to contribute.

### Major Features:

+ Minimalistic Design
+ "Request Information" Button
+ Provided Links and Information for Each Charity/ Non-profit Organization

### Languages/ Tool Sets/ Third-Party Code:

+ Not sure yet

### Audience for Project:

+ Members of local communities
